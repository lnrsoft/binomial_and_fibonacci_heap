Binomial heap, Lazy binomial heap and Fibonacci heap
===========================

These three data structures are ones of the most difficult I ever had to code. I coded them when I was in the university and I leave them here because I think they are interesting to have them in mind.

Note: Do not use them for a real project. If you seriously need a Fibonacci heap or a Binomial heap, please use the ones provided by Boost ;)
